This is some practice with natural language processing (specifically context free grammar) for [CS50's Parser](https://cs50.harvard.edu/ai/2024/projects/6/parser/). I wrote all the the rules used by the NLTK (natural language tool kit) to parse sentences. I also wrote the preprocess and np_chunk functions to tokenize sentences into all lower case words and then find all the noun phrases (NPs) in a given sentence.
